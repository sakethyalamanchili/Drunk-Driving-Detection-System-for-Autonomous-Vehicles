# Drunk Driving Detection System for Autonomous Vehicles

## Overview

The Drunk Driving Detection System for Autonomous Vehicles project is dedicated to preventing accidents caused by impaired driving. Utilizing basic Arduino technology, our goal is to develop a simple yet effective solution to enhance road safety.

## How It Works

### Components
- Arduino Board
- MQ3 Alcohol Sensor
- LCD Display
- RGB LED (Red and Green)
- Buzzer
- DC Motor

## How to Use

1. Set up the components as shown in the circuit diagram.
2. Load the Arduino code onto your board.
3. Monitor the LCD display for alcohol alerts.
4. If alcohol is detected, the system will sound alarms, stop the car, and prevent it from starting until it's safe.

## Challenges Faced

- **Learning to Solder:** Overcoming the challenge of soldering for the first time while connecting components to the zero PCB.
- **Connection Reliability:** Starting with a breadboard with loose connections and later shifting to a zero PCB for more stable connections.
- **Power Supply Setup:** Improvising the power supply by using a cut mobile charger cable and a power bank for the project.

## Achievements

- Completed the mini-model on time.
- Designed simple hardware circuits for an effective alcohol detection device.
- Overcame soldering challenges to create a functional system.

## Future Plans

- **Text Alerts (GSM):** Notify friends or family if alcohol levels are high and the car has stopped.
- **Location Tracking (GPS):** Enable real-time vehicle tracking in emergencies.
- **Enhanced Safety Measures:** Include features to prevent driving under the influence of other substances.

The Drunk Driving Detection System for Autonomous Vehicles project reflects our commitment to road safety and continuous improvement, integrating basic technologies for the betterment of society.
